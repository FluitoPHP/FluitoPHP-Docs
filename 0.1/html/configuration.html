                An application should be built on the configuration required to run the same, and so is the <strong>FluitoPHP</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>FluitoPHP</strong> uses strong configuration that is secure and can be updated very easily. For example changing the database of the application is extremely easy and it requires updating a simple configuration file.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make the configuration secure, we recommend revealing only html directory of the application through the web server. Thought we have enforced the security through .htaccess files also, but it is strongly recommended to reveal only html directory and not other directories.
